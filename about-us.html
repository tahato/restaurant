      Restaurants know the importance of a strong first impression. It's why
      they invest in exterior design, decorate their entranceways and train
      hosts to welcome guests with a warm smile. Nowadays, however, more than
      70% of diners visit a restaurant's website before deciding where to dine,
      which means the first impression happens long before they set foot
      on-premises. It happens online. And when it does, the restaurant
      description plays a pivotal role. Despite this, many restaurants struggle
      to write an effective description for their website. Doing so requires a
      mix of skills not every restaurant has — writing, design and a keen
      understanding of digital user behavior — but there are tools in place to
      make the job easier. For example, if you build your website with BentoBox,
      full-service designers can help create your website on a template that is
      proven to be user-friendly. That takes care of the design and user
      behavior hurdles. To help overcome the writing hurdle, we've created the
      resource below. In addition to defining best practices, we have curated 20
      examples of effective restaurant descriptions and analyzed why they work.
      If you don't know where to start or feel stuck, scroll through these
      examples and see if they spark new ideas.
